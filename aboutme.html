            <p class="card-text">Out of high school, I studied at Upskilled, which is an online University recognised by the Australian Government.
              This is where I obtained my diploma. Which was a diploma in programming.

            <p class="card-text">After Upskilled, I attended MIT and is where I currently am. The courses that I'm doing are web development based. 
              Here I am doing three short courses to learn JavaScript and the fundamentals of Web Developement. 
              I also wanted to study at one of the top Universites in the world just to see what it was like. Also having the name, "MIT" on my resume will be good.
